# Variational Autoencoders and Latent Diffusion Models

**Python, PyTorch**

This project implements Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and extends it with a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) for generating high-quality images from latent spaces.

## Highlights

- Implemented a CNN-based VAE with Ï‰-VAE loss on MNIST and Hotdog datasets
- Designed a Unet-based DDPM to sample from learned latent representations
- Visualized the latent space using t-SNE and interpolation
